# Cathedral Controlled v0 Merge Note

> [!WARNING]
> **Historical record.** This describes the v0 launch scaffold as of June 2026. It
> is not current operating guidance. Validators: use
> [`cathedral-validator`](https://github.com/cathedralai/cathedral-validator). What
> runs today: see the [README](README.md).

Status: ready for controlled/no-hardware v0. Not ready for a broad production
hardware ask until real secure-compute evidence reaches the full gate.

## What This Merge Proves

- SAT scoring defaults to proportional composition over distinct verified solves.
- Per-miner beta scoring is coldkey-aware when coldkey collapse is enabled, so
  stacked hotkeys under one coldkey share score instead of multiplying it.
- Submit endpoints now require solution-bound signatures; blank active-CNF
  signatures cannot be reused to rank work.
- Pre-auth rate limiting no longer trusts unverified hotkey headers.
- The active board can expose scoring policy and tier distribution metadata.
- After deploy and live smoke, miners can query a public explanation for their
  current scoring inputs.
- Secure Compute intake remains default-off, consented, invite/allowlist-gated,
  and operator-gated.
- Google TPU intake is exploratory only: not Chutes-listable and not emissions-eligible.
- Audit Arena accepts SAT-backed witnesses only after deterministic replay.
- Distillation exports are private by default and public export is disclosure-gated.
- Publisher, Postgres, validator CLI, attestation, arena, and launch-readiness
  paths pass local verifier gates.

## Commands Run

Core WSL/local suite:

```bash
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python attest_verify.py
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python distillation_verify.py
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python audit_arena_verify.py
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python arena_runner_verify.py
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python rc_verify.py
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python weights_verify.py
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python tee_gpu_verify.py
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python launch_readiness_verify.py
```

Result: pass.

Publisher E2E with publisher extras:

```bash
uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python publisher_verify.py
```

Result:

```text
PUBLISHER VERIFY: PASS all 98 checks
```

Postgres E2E used an ephemeral PostgreSQL 16 server unpacked under `/tmp` from
Ubuntu packages and a local `DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
scripts/verify_ephemeral_postgres.sh
```

Result:

```text
POSTGRES VERIFY: PASS all 33 checks
```

Postgres now applies 23 migrations and verifies 14 core tables, including
`coldkey_map`.

Controlled launch readiness:

```bash
python3 launch_readiness_report.py --profile no-hardware-v0 --require-ready
```

Result:

```text
Cathedral launch readiness: READY
Profile: controlled-v0
Score: 91.0/100.0 (91.0%)
Blockers: none
Deferred gates:
  - compute_real_verifier_tested
  - compute_provider_listing_verified
  - compute_health_and_revenue_verified
```

Hygiene:

```bash
git diff --check
python -m compileall scaffold publisher_verify.py weights_verify.py tee_gpu_verify.py launch_readiness_verify.py scripts/cathedral_live_table.py
```

Result: pass.

Post-deploy smoke:

```bash
BASE_URL=https://api.cathedral.computer uv run --with-requirements deploy/requirements.txt python live_smoke.py
```

Result against current production: expected fail before deploy. Current prod does
not yet expose board `generator` / `scoring` / `distribution` or
`/v1/leaderboard/explain`, and one submit attempt hit `429 submit_busy_retry`.
Rerun this after Railway deploy before claiming the deployed miner experience is
live.

## Not Claimable Yet

Full production hardware launch is still blocked by real-world evidence:

- `compute_real_verifier_tested`
- `compute_provider_listing_verified`
- `compute_health_and_revenue_verified`

Before asking miners broadly to buy or rent hardware, one real machine must
complete:

1. signed offer
2. fresh evidence request
3. real TDX plus NVIDIA GPU confidential-compute verification
4. provider listing acceptance
5. health receipt
6. usage or revenue receipt
7. DB-backed readiness report at 100 / 100
